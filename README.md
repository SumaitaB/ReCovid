# ReCovid Mobile App
<i> Let’s Recover from Covid-19 </i>

### What does the project do?
Covid-19 in the form of a pandemic has managed to create impediments in our lives since day 01. The pandemic has created a stigmatized situation in the country and so, whenever someone is found to be tested positive for the virus, most people don’t bother helping or caring at all.


To solve this major problem, introducing ReCovid, a mobile app that aims at making personal and community life easier by creating a safe platform not just for patients but also doctors, volunteers and people who recovered from Covid-19. 

ReCovid is an app that provides medical advice, emergency contacts, mental health support, helps you match with a plasma donor, go for food subscriptions all under one app and aids your recovery positively while creating a safe platform by creating bridges among patients, doctors, volunteers and the people who have recovered successfully from Covid-19.

The app works by turning those who recovered from Covid-19 into heroes by providing them a platform to make a change, connecting patients to doctors for consultation, offering secure plasma donations, providing a platform for Covid-19 counselling from those who will understand the emotional toll that the disease takes on someone having gone through it and, creating a food subscription process through which people can pay to get home-cooked, nutritious meals and groceries from people who are looking forward to helping out by finding an opportunity to make some money.

On the app’s dashboard, there are 6 options:
     <b>Talk to someone, Text someone, Consult, Food Subscription, Find Donor, Corona life.</b>

Note: The app is to be used while being connected to the internet.
### What/Who was the inspiration?
When Covid-19 took the form of a pandemic, people seem to be reluctant about helping people who got tested positive for the virus fearing that they might catch it too. Also, patients and those who recovered face a lot of stigma in the society and are often outcast by those around them. Besides taking a toll on the patient's physical health, COVID-19 causes emotional damage too due to the stigmatization and uncertainties and hence, these people (both patients and recovered) who are suffering while being shunned and neglected by other people became our prime motivation for this project.

Getting a good grip of MAD (Mobile App Development), ways to ensure proper team work and establishing proper team communication while learning how to divide the tasks among the team members effectively.

### What’s next for our project?

1.	After Covid-19, our strategy is to put the project to use by handling Covid-19 aftermath. Meaning, we plan on including newer features about providing the people in need with post Covid-19 mental health consultation.

2.	We plan on focusing on food subscription. As a lot of senior members of the society and busy people seek home-cooked meals and groceries, finding volunteers for them through the app will ensure an excellent way of creating opportunities for the interested people to earn money by creating a business for supplying home-cooked meals and groceries.

3.	As we have already ensured collection of a vast amount of data related to doctors and created a database on that, we plan on turning this app into a app that may help doctors establish connection with patients suffering from different kinds of diseases and engaging volunteers looking forward to helping for other health, community and society related virtuous causes.

### How is does our project create social awareness?

1.	Our project is an excellent way of creating community engagement as it focuses on helping the community create an easier way of ensuring health, communication, food subscription as well safe blood and plasma donation.

2.	It is also great for ensuring education and awareness as the app includes a feature called “Corona Life” which consists of blogs and websites that will help one gather knowledge on Covid-19 and related topics.

3.	It is also a commercially viable project as it creates a way for people to start small business involving home-cooked meals and groceries to supply to the interested people through our app.

4.	In general, the app is a great hack for Bangladesh considering our economy and the problems faced on a regular basis by the citizens.
